# odin-sign-up
In this project I will complete a basic sign-up page.

The page has two columns. The left column contains a background image and an overlay with a logo. The right column contains the body of text, the form and the sign-up button. The columns are structured using flexbox.

This project exemplifies HTML skills with using forms and client-side validation using built-in validation as well as RegEx patterns.

The project is also an exercise in several CSS concepts:
* Default styles and default style resets
* Importing and using custom fonts
* Advanced CSS selectors
* Positioning using Relative and Absolute
* Custom properties for a color schema, also known as CSS variables
* Pseudoclasses for form styling, including :focus, :valid, :invalid, :hover
